# AppContainer
I wanted to gather the projects made by everyone who started learning software under a single project. I think about adding new projects every day<hr>
###Get Started
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.<hr>

###Installation Process
Run npm install to install all the required dependencies
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can also access the live demo:  <a href="https://app-container.netlify.app" target="_blank">AppContainer</a><hr>
